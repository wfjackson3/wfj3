# My personal core values
What is a core value? A core value is something is you believe in so much, that you value so much, that life wouldn’t be worth living without it. Many people find it difficult to accept those circumstances because we obviously have an impact on the world we live in. Still, if these things were simply not possible, I would have a hard time finding value in life.

## Accomplish something
If we don’t accomplish something, why do we come together at all?

## Tell the whole truth
Share only and all of what we know to be true. If we always start with the truth, we can work together to find our way through anything.

## Share your gifts
Who we are and what we do can have a positive impact on our world. We wouldn’t be standing on the shoulders of giants if they didn’t share their gifts. Be the giants of tomorrow.

## Put happiness first
When we do things that make us happy, life is always good.

## Find the right balance
This does not mean compromise. It does not mean design by consensus. The success of any pursuit involves finding the appropriate balance between multiple factors. Some objectives will require 95% of factor A and 5% of factor B. Be willing to find the right balance.

If you see me do something that doesn’t fit my values, please speak up! I try to live my life according to my values, but I am human.
